# Foodie
A quick little project I made during BattleHack'15. The purpose of Foodie is to help people try out foods from other cultures and hopefully make a new friend in the process!

## Tech
Instead of going the traditional app route I decided to make it a bit unique and play around with the sponsor APIs a bit. I used node.js as the backend language and hosted it on Heroku. Used Twilio for the UX, so all user interaction is done via SMS.

## Usage
The demo has been taken down for now but feel free to clone this repo and setup your own Twilio API keys in your environment variables and enjoy. You can message that number with `Yo foodie` to get list of available commands.
